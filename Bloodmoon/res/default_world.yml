# You must append a ;s, ;f or ;p at the end of the command:

# ex. SLOW;100;3;false
# this will apply slow 3 for 5 seconds
# mob equipment is only available for the following mobs: zombie, husk, skeleton, stray, wither_skeletor
# slot names: main-hand, off-hand, helmet, chestplate, leggings, boots
# ex.  equipment:

# if you're smart you can use a loottable to automatically serialized the items you want
# speaking of loottables, loottable will just take the name of a loottable
# if you created one using "/bm loot <name> create" you will still have to reload the plugin before it applies
